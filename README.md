### Business Card Information ###
In development, I have not even started the software. This is open source hardware like all of my designs.

### Plastic Frog ###
Rubber Ducky knockoff. I have sourced USB swivel drive cases. It is surprising how hard that was to find. Trivial to buy with the usb board, and its easy to find just the usb pcb but hard to find the case. Should cost $0.99 to build.
